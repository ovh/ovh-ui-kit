  Define the base icon size for the generator:

  `icon-font-generator` normalize the size of all icons, based on the size of the first parsed.
  With this workaround, we don't need to resize all icons used for the webfont.

  A lower size result in bad/weird rendered icons.
  A higher size result with better shaped icons, but increase the font size.
  `128px` value seems a good compromise for the concept icons, that are very thin.
